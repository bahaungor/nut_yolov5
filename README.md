# Wheel Nut Detection with Artificial Intelligence - YOLOv5

## Introduction
This repository contains the actual training code (`Hubnut Detection W Yolov5.ipynb`) used to develop a YOLOv5 model that can detect incorrect or missing wheel nut installation on vehicles. The model uses image processing and data augmentation techniques to train on a dataset of images containing both correctly and incorrectly installed nuts. The model also ensures the correct type of nut is installed, as there are 6 different types of nuts.

It is important to note that this code was deployed for Toyota and is not intended for commercial use or distribution. The purpose of this project is to showcase my image processing, augmentation, and modeling skills to potential employers.

## Model Performance
The YOLOv5 model achieved a remarkable **accuracy of 100%** in detecting incorrect or missing wheel nut installation on vehicles. It checks 20,000 wheel nuts a day, equivalent to 600,000 a month, without any false negatives or false positives. This high level of accuracy is a testament to the effectiveness of the YOLOv5 model and my ability to develop and train high-performing computer vision models.

## Usage
This repository contains the training code and is not intended for use as a standalone program. The notebook (`Hubnut Detection W Yolov5.ipynb`) can be used as a reference for similar projects, but please note that this is not intended to be a step-by-step guide for developing a YOLOv5 model.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed by Bahadır ÜNGÖR for Toyota Turkey, demonstrating my skills and expertise in computer vision and deep learning.
